
Each case is a light curve (brightness of an object sampled over time) from NASA's Kepler mission (3-month-long series, sampled every ~30 min: 4767 samples per time series), focusing on A 
and F-type stars with eﬀective temperatures in the range 6500–10,000 K. The data are hand-labeled by experts in asteroseismology from The University of Sydney.  


There are X cases. All series are an equal length. Missing values have already been interpolated. We have performed a stratified sample for 70% train cases and 30% test cases. The class labels (and propirtion) are:

1 = Contact eclipsing binary
2 = Detached eclipsing binary
3 = Delta Scuti variable
4 = Gamma Doradus variable
5 = Non variable
6 = Rotational variable
7 = RR Lyrae variable
